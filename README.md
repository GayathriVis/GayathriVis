- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gayathri Viswanath. I am a researcher at Stockholm University's Department of Astronomy.
- ðŸ‘€ My research in Astronomy focuses on Exoplanet detection and characterisation. I use high-contrast tools like adaptive optics, coronagraphy and echelle spectrographs to investigate young planets that are undergoing formation, in an attempt to understand the phenomenon of sub-stellar formation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working with ground-based observations from the high-resolution spectrograph UVES at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, to study the process of gas accretion in the final stages of the formation of gas giant planets.
