- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am Gayathri, an Astronomer at Stockholm University, from Kerala, India.
- ðŸ‘€ My research in Astronomy focuses on Exoplanet detection and characterisation. I use high-contrast tools like adaptive optics, coronagraphy and echelle spectrographs to investigate young planets that are undergoing formation, in an attempt to understand the phenomenon of sub-stellar formation.
- ðŸŒ± I'm a Data Science enthusiast and love coding in Python. I am constantly looking for new opportunities and challenges to expand my skills in data handling, data processing and data analysis.
